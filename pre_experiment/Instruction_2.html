Your task is to select to "Go" or "Not go" to the store, given your demand (desired number of items),
and the displayed inventory  on the website. Your decision screen is as follow:
<img src="{{ static 'example_exp.png' }}"

     height="200" />
<br>
<br>

Once you make your decision the actual inventory will be revealed. The actual inventory will be equal
to the displayed inventory minus the inventory error. For instance, if the displayed inventory is 6 units and the inventory error is 2 units, the actual inventory will be 4 units.
