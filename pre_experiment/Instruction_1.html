Imagine you want to go to a store to purchase some goods. Before going to the store, you check online the good's inventory at the store to decide whether or not you should go. You know how many items that you
would like to buy. However, the inventory information displayed online might be incorrect due to lost, misplaced inventory or outdated information.
 <br>  <br>If you go the store there is sufficient inventory you will get a bonus. If you go to the store and
there is no sufficient inventory you will face a penalty. If you decide to not go to the store it will not affect your reward.
<br>
<br>
Example: On the website of a furniture store, you can check the number of available items of a product at that store
