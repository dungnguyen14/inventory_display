You want to go to a store to purchase some goods. Before going to the store, you check online the good's inventory at the store to decide whether or not you should go. You know how many items that you
would like to buy. However, the inventory information displayed online might be incorrect, e.g., since inventory has been lost, misplaced or it is just outdated.
 <br>  <br>If you go the store and sufficient inventory is available you will get a bonus. If you go to the store and
there is no sufficient inventory you will face a penalty. If you decide to not go to the store it will not affect your reward.

Example: On the website of Decathlon, you can check the number of available items of a product at each store
