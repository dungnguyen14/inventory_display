Your task is to select to "Go" or "Not go" to the store, given your demand (desired number of items),
and the displayed inventory  on the website. Your decision screen is as follow:
<img src="{{ static 'example_exp.png' }}"

     height="200" />

After that the actual inventory will be revealed, which reflects the fact that we only know
how many items are actually available when visiting the store. The actual inventory will be equal
to the displayed inventory minus the inventory error.
