You check online the inventory at the store to decide whether or not to go to the store to purchase certain goods. You know the number of units that
would need to buy. However, the inventory information displayed online might be incorrect, e.g., since inventory has been lost, misplaced or it is just outdated.
 <br>  <br>If you go the store and sufficient inventory is available you will get a bonus of {{C.payment_per_correct_answer}} coin, if you go to the store and
there is no sufficient inventory you will face a penalty of  <mark>{{player.penalty_per_wrong_answer}}</mark>  coins. If you decide to not go to the store it will not affect your payment.

{{ if player.round_number == 7  }}
  <br>   <br><p style="background-color: #FFFF00"> Now you get the information that the displayed inventory has an error the U(0,4). e.g. it is equally likely that the inventory is 0,1,2,3 or 4 units lower than the displayed inventory. For example, if the displayed inventory is 6 units, it is equally likely that the actual inventory is 6,5,4,3 or 2 units.
Of course inventory cannot be negative, if the displayed inventory is 2 there is a 60% chance that the actual inventory is 0, a 20% chance that inventory is 1 and a 20% chance that inventory is 2.  </p>
